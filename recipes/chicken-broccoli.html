        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high
                until shimmery, about 2 minutes. Meanwhile, stir together
                chicken and 1 tablespoon of cornstarch in a medium bowl
                until chicken is coated.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add chicken to skillet in a single layer and cook,
                stirring often, until crisp and cooked through, about
                6 minutes. Add onions, and cook, stirring often, until
                translucent, about 1 minute. Add ginger and garlic;
                cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute.
                Transfer chicken mixture to a plate and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add broccoli to empty skillet, and cook over medium-high,
                stirring occasionally, until bright green and heated
                through, 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, whisk together water, soy sauce, oyster sauce,
                brown sugar, crushed red pepper, black pepper, and
                remaining 2 tablespoons cornstarch in a small bowl until
                smooth, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add cooked chicken mixture to broccoli in skillet; add soy
                sauce mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until broccoli
                and chicken are well coated, and sauce thickens, about 2 
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve immediately. Enjoy!
