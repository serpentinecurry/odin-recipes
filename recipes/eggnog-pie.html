        <p>
            A Bavarian cream pie made with homemade eggnog that can be

            crust can be substituted by a graham cracker.

            <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
            <li>1/4 cup rum</li>
            <li>1 cup whipping cream</li>
            <li>1/4 pinch white sugar</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, combine gelatin and cold water; set
                aside to soften. Combine milk and 1/2 cup sugar in a
                small glass bowl. Microwave for 3 minutes or until milk
                begins to boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a steady stream, pour hot milk into beaten eggs,
                whisking constantly. Cook custard in the microwave,
                whisking after each minute, until it thickens slightly,
                about 2 minutes. Stir in softened gelatin and mix until
                melted. Stir in rum.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let filling cool to room temperature. (If you refrigerate
                it, stir occasionally to prevent gelatin from setting too
                soon.)
            </li>
            <li>
                In a medium bowl, whip cream until soft peaks form;
                beat in 1/4 cup sugar.
            </li>
            <li>
                Set aside 1/2 cup of whipped cream for garnish; keep
                refrigerated. Fold remaining whipped cream into eggnog
                mixture. Pour filling into pie crust and refrigerate 4
                hours or overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Garnish with reserved whipped cream and a dusting of
                nutmeg.
            </li>
        </ol>
